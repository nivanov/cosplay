/**
  * Scene object that has no rendering content of its own.
  *
  * This type of sprites is typically used for keyboard handlers or shaders-only rendering, e.g. fade in of the entire
  * screen, etc. Note that shaders must be attached to some scene object but that object doesn't have to be visible for
  * the shader to render - hence the convenience of using off-screen sprites for screen-wide shader rendering. Off-screen
  * sprite has its visible flag set to `false`, XY-coordinate set to `(0,0)` and its Z-index set to zero. Its dimension
  * set to [[CPDim.ZERO]] and it shape set to [[CPRect.ZERO]] as well.
  *
  * Since this is an off-screen, invisible sprite the method [[CPSceneObject.render()]] will never
  * be called. Use [[CPSceneObject.update()]] callback, if necessary, instead and make sure to
  * call `super.update(...)`.
  *
  * ### Sprites
  * CosPlay provides number of built-in sprites. A sprite is a scene objects, visible or off-screen,
  * that is custom designed for a particular use case. Built-in sprites provide concrete
  * implementations for the abstract methods in the base [[CPSceneObject]] class. Most non-trivial games
  * will use combination of the built-in sprites and their own ones. Here's the list of the built-in
  * sprites:
  *  - [[CPCanvasSprite]]
  *  - [[CPImageSprite]]
  *  - [[CPLabelSprite]]
  *  - [[CPVideoSprite]]
  *  - [[CPStaticImageSprite]]
  *  - [[CPOffScreenSprite]]
  *  - [[CPKeyboardSprite]]
  *  - [[CPParticleSprite]]
  *  - [[CPTextInputSprite]]
  *
  * @param id Optional ID of this scene object. By default, the random 6-character ID will be used.
  * @param shaders Optional sequence of shaders for this sprite.
  * @param tags Optional set of organizational or grouping tags. By default, the empty set is used.
