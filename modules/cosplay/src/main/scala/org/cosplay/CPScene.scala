/**
  * A scene is a container for [[CPSceneObject scene objects]]. Scene objects from the scene are drawn on the
  * screen on each frame.
  *
  * Scene has an ID, optional dimension and one or more scene objects. Note that scene must always have at
  * least one scene object. In CosPlay there is no hierarchy of scene objects in the scene - all scene objects form
  * a simple flat structure inside of the scene. Just like with any other [[CPGameObject game objects]], you can use
  * [[CPGameObject.getTags tags]] to organize scenes and scene objects.
  *
  * ### Creating A Scene
  * Scene has a strong encapsulation contract in relation to its scene objects: you can only add initial scene objects to
  * the scene at the time of scene creation. Once scene is created, its constituent scene objects can only be
  * manipulated via methods in [[CPSceneObjectContext]] class passed to scene objects on each frame update.
  *
  * In CosPlay you create a new scene in one of two ways:
  *  - Instantiate [[CPScene]] class.<br/>
  *    When creating an instance of [[CPScene]] class you'll be using one of the constructors provided by [[CPScene]]
  *    class. Every constructor requires a set of initial scene objects to be supplied.
  *    {{{
  *        val myScene = new CPScene("id", None, bgPx, spr1, spr2)
  *    }}}
  *  - Extend [[CPScene]] class.<br/>
  *    When subclassing [[CPScene]] you need to use [[addObjects()]] method available to the sub-classes to add
  *    initial scene objects.
  *    {{{
  *         object MyScene extends CPScene("id", None, bgPx):
  *             addObjects(spr1, spr2)
  *    }}}
  *
  * Note that you can dynamically add and remove scene as well as scene objects via [[CPSceneObjectContext]] instance.
  * See [[CPSceneObjectContext]] API for more details.
  *
  * ### Scene Dimension
  * CosPlay scene can be *adaptive* or *static* in terms of its dimensions. When scene dimension
  * is set it becomes unchangeable (static) for the lifecycle of the scene and its scene objects can rely on this fact. However,
  * if scene dimension is set as `None`, it will adapt to the terminal dimension on each frame meaning that the scene's
  * dimension and therefore its canvas on which all scene objects are rendered can change its size from frame to
  * frame. Make sure that all scene objects in the adaptive scene take this into account in their rendering routines.
  *
  * @param id ID of the scene.
  * @param dim Optional dimension of the scene. Note that if dimension is `None` then scene will adapt to the
  *     terminal dimension on each frame. That means that the scene's canvas on which all scene objects are
  *     rendered can change its size from frame to frame. In such case, make sure that all scene objects take this into
  *     account in their rendering routines.
  * @param bgPx Background pixel of the scene. Background pixel is shown when none of the scene objects
  *     has drawn a pixel at that particular coordinate. Background pixel must have background color defined.
  * @see [[CPEngine.startGame()]]
  * @see [[org.cosplay.prefabs.scenes.CPFadeShimmerLogoScene]]
