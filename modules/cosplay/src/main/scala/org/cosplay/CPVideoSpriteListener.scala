/**
  * Listener for [[CPVideoSprite]] playback.
  *
  * You can add and remove this listener to video sprite using [[CPVideoSprite.addListener()]] and
  * [[CPVideoSprite.removeListener()]] methods.
  *
  * Video support consists of three key components:
  *  - [[CPVideo]]
  *  - [[CPVideoSprite]]
  *  - [[CPVideoSpriteListener]]
  *
  * Video is defined as a sequence of same-sized frames where each frame is an image. [[CPVideoSprite]] provides
  * rendering of that video while [[CPVideoSpriteListener]] allows the video playback to synchronize with
  * other action in the game like sound or animation. Note that video sprite does not provide any playback
  * controls out of the box.
  *
  * Here's some useful links for ASCII video in general:
  *  - Use [[https://www.ffmpeg.org/]] or similar to convert video into separate still images.
  *  - Use [[https://github.com/cslarsen/jp2a]] or similar to convert individual JPGs into ASCII.
  *  - [[https://john.dev/b?id=2019-02-23-ascii-face]] provides full example of ASCII vide.
  *
  * @example See [[org.cosplay.examples.video.CPVideoExample CPVideoExample]] class for the example of
  *     using video support.
  * @see [[CPVideoSprite.addListener()]]
  * @see [[CPVideoSprite.removeListener()]]
