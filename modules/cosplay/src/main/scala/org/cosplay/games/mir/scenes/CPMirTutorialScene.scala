           |  <@ Tutorial @>
           |  ----------
           |
           |  1. <~Overview~>
           |  -----------
           |  <%Escape From Mir%> is a real time strategy game based on in-depth space
           |  station Mir simulation that requires discovery, problem solving and knowledge
           |  of the basic physics principles, engineering and computer science. Yes... this
           |  is the game where you code programs, crawl the file system, hack the OS and
           |  even solve equations to find your way out of the calamity of the orbital crash.
           |
           |  2. <~Controls~>
           |  -----------
           |  You interact with the Mir space station via MirX - a Unix-like operating system
           |  available through the terminal you spotted when you regained the consciousness.
           |  MirX has all the major attributes of the modern Unix OS architecture including
           |  Unix shell and many familiar commands.
           |
           |  Throughout the game you can also use the following keyboard shortcuts:
           |  <%[F10]%>    - Open Game Menu
           |  <%[F12]%>    - Take *.xp Screenshot
           |  <%[CTRL-Q]%> - Toggle FPS Overlay
           |  <%[CTRL-L]%> - Open Dev Mode
           |
           |  Every 60 seconds games performs auto-save that you can load later from the
           |  main menu. You can also save the current game state manually from the same
           |  menu.
           |
           |  3. <~Strategy~>
           |  -----------
           |  Use common sense... Solve life threatening problems first. Seek out your
           |  remaining crew. Establish communications with Mission Control Center and devise
           |  the rescue plan. Be prepared for the unexpected. If things feel repetitive or
           |  mundane - there is always a way to automate it. Snoop around - the clues can be
           |  in unusual places. Remember that when in game the time flows in real time.
           |
           |  Above all - you must escape from Mir to survive!
