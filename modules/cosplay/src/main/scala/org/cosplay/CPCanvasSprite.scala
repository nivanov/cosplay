/**
  * Scene object tailor-made for canvas drawing.
  *
  * Canvas sprite takes dimension of the current [[CPSceneObjectContext.getCameraFrame camera frame]].
  * That allows its [[CPSceneObject.render()]] method, the only one method that needs to be implemented by
  * the sub-type, to draw on entire camera frame of the terminal.
  *
  * Note that by default this sprite sets its position and dimension equal to the entire camera frame. This may
  * affect shaders attached to this sprite if they are configured to work with object vs. entire frame since
  * this sprite will report its size as entire camera frame size. Shaders that work with this sprite should
  * account for it.
  *
  * Note, if overriding [[CPSceneObject.update()]] method make sure to call `super.update(...)`.
  *
  * ### Sprites
  * CosPlay provides number of built-in sprites. A sprite is a scene objects, visible or off-screen,
  * that is custom designed for a particular use case. Built-in sprites provide concrete
  * implementations for the abstract methods in the base [[CPSceneObject]] class. Most non-trivial games
  * will use combination of the built-in sprites and their own ones. Here's the list of the built-in
  * sprites:
  *  - [[CPCanvasSprite]]
  *  - [[CPImageSprite]]
  *  - [[CPStaticImageSprite]]
  *  - [[CPLabelSprite]]
  *  - [[CPVideoSprite]]
  *  - [[CPOffScreenSprite]]
  *  - [[CPKeyboardSprite]]
  *  - [[CPParticleSprite]]
  *  - [[CPTextInputSprite]]
  *
  * @param id Optional ID of this sprite.
  * @param shaders Optional list of [[CPShader shaders]] attached to this canvas sprite.
  * @param tags Optional set of organizational or grouping tags. By default, the empty set is used.
  * @see [[CPSceneObjectContext.getCanvas]] to get current canvas you can draw on.
  * @see [[CPCanvas]] various API to draw on the canvas.
