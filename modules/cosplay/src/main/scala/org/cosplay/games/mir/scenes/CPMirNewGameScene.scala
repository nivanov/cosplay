          |  Based on real events (*)
          |
          |  The year is <%1997%>. It’s been 11 years since the launch of the Russian's
          |  <%Mir%> space station - the world’s first permanent human habitat in orbit
          |  above the planet Earth. Over the decade the Mir station has been
          |  assembled from 7 separate modules and is now manned by an international
          |  crew of 3 astronauts.
          |
          |  On the morning of <%June 25%> the unmanned resupply vessel <%Progress%>-34 that
          |  arrived just a few months earlier crashed into Mir space station during
          |  routine training re-docking procedure causing critical station damage.
          |  Status of the remaining crew is unknown, air is leaking, structural and
          |  orbit control damage alarm is on, the power supply subsystem is offline.
          |
          |  Your name is <%$name%> (@<%$username%>), $role. You regain
          |  consciousness in the air locked "Core Module" of the station. Through
          |  the zero-gravity mayhem of the crash you see a working computer terminal
          |  that is... rebooting.
          |
