/**
  * Scene object context during frame update.
  *
  * This type is main access point to the most of CosPlay functionality for the scene objects comprising
  * the gameplay. On each game frame update all scene objects from the current scene receive [[CPSceneObject.update()]] call
  * and optional [[CPSceneObject.render()]] call both of which receive the instance of this type. Also, the
  * [[CPShader shaders]] attached to that scene objects, if any, receive the callback with the instance of this type.
  *
  * Scene object context functionality can be grouped into:
  *  - Keyboard input focus [[CPSceneObjectContext.getFocusOwner management]]
  *  - Accessing, adding, and removing scene objects
  *  - Access [[CPSceneObjectContext.getGameCache game]] and [[CPSceneObjectContext.getSceneCache scene]] user-data storage
  *  - Access [[CPSceneObjectContext.getLog game log]]
  *  - [[CPSceneObjectContext.addScene() Adding]], [[CPSceneObjectContext.deleteScene() removing]], and [[CPSceneObjectContext.switchScene() switching]] scenes
  *  - Check [[CPSceneObjectContext.collisions() collisions]]
  *  - [[CPSceneObjectContext.sendMessage() Send]] and [[CPSceneObjectContext.receiveMessage() receive]] messages between scene objects
  *  - Accessing game & [[CPSceneObjectContext.getRenderStats rendering]] statistics
  *  - Getting scene [[CPSceneObjectContext.getCanvas canvas]] to draw on
  *  - Accessing scene [[CPSceneObjectContext.getCamera camera descriptor]]
  *  - [[CPSceneObjectContext.exitGame() Exiting]] game
