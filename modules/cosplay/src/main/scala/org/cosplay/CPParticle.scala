/**
  * Programmable particle.
  *
  * Particle is part of the particle effect animation support. Particle effect support consists of three key components:
  *  - [[CPParticle Particle]]
  *  - [[CPParticleEmitter Particle emitter]]
  *  - [[CPParticleSprite Particle sprite]]
  *
  * Particle defines a single-pixel element (a-la mini-sprite) that has its own lifecycle and gets updated on each
  * frame update. Particle emitter is a components that is responsible for creating particles. And particle
  * sprite ties all that together into single renderable component. Particle sprite can have one or more particle
  * emitters and each emitter can create multiple particles. One of the key features of particle effect support is its
  * modularity: particle implementation can be reused by multiple emitters, and an emitter implementation can be reused by
  * multiple independent particle sprites.
  *
  * @example See [[org.cosplay.examples.particle.CPParticleExample CPParticleExample]] class for the example of
  *     using particle effect.
